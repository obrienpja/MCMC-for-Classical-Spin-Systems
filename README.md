# MCSM
Monte Carlo for Statistical Mechanics

The goal of this project is to simulate physics in lattice systems. The first system we study here is the Ising model.
We can see very readily in our results that finding the ground state of the system is extremely unlikely unless we apply 
the concept of simulated annealing.
